Task 2: Phishing Email Analysis

Objective:
Identify phishing indicators within a suspicious email to enhance awareness of cyber threats and build practical email analysis skills.

Description:
In this task, we analyzed a real phishing email (sample-10.eml) designed to impersonate Microsoft. The email falsely warns about unusual sign-in activity and urges the recipient to "report the user."

Key red flags identified include:

A spoofed sender domain (access-accsecurity.com)

Reply-to address using a personal Gmail (sotrecognizd@gmail.com)

SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication failures

Urgent and fear-based language to pressure the user

Malicious links disguised as buttons that initiate email replies


Header analysis revealed the email originated from an IP unrelated to Microsoft. The message formatting mimicked official Microsoft branding but contained no personalization or secure URLs.

This task demonstrates how attackers use social engineering and technical tricks to deceive users. By reviewing headers, links, and content structure, we gained hands-on experience in recognizing phishing attempts.

Outcome:
A practical understanding of how phishing emails are crafted and how to spot them using both visual cues and technical header analysis.
